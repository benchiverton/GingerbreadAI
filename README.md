# Gingerbread AI

Yet another AI library.

#### [NeuralNetwork](NeuralNetwork)

C# libraries that allow you to model neural the following neural networks:

* Fully Connected Neural Networks
* Convolutional Neural Networks (1D, 2D w/ filtering)

There are also deep learning algorithms that support the training of these networks via backpropagation with smoothing/momentum.

##### [Documentation](Documentation)

Various documentation that has been written explaining some of the decisions taken when writing the GingerbreadAI library.

## Getting Started

Open the [GingerbreadAI.NeuralNetwork.Test](NeuralNetwork/GingerbreadAI.NeuralNetwork.Test.sln) solution file.

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio 2019 (with dotnet core 3.1)

## Unit tests

All unit tests should be runnable from the [GingerbreadAI.NeuralNetwork.Test](NeuralNetwork/GingerbreadAI.NeuralNetwork.Test.sln) solution.

### Long running tests

Longer running tests that produce a report can only be run in debug, and can be found in the GinbergreadAI.NeuralNetwork.Tests project, which is in the [GingerbreadAI.NeuralNetwork.Test](NeuralNetwork/GingerbreadAI.NeuralNetwork.Test.sln) solution.
